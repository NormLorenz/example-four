It sounds like you're encountering an issue where the HTML content is pasted as raw text or code rather than rendering correctly in OneNote. This might happen due to how OneNote interprets pasted content.

Here are a few tips to address this:

Use the Paste Options: After pasting the HTML into OneNote, a small clipboard icon often appears near the pasted content. Click on it to select a different paste option, like "Keep Source Formatting" or "Merge Formatting."

Use the Insert Functionality:

Save the HTML file on your computer.

Go to OneNote, click on the Insert tab, and choose File Printout or File Attachment. This will allow you to include the HTML as a readable file or as an image.

Third-Party Converters: You could convert the HTML into a PDF or an image before importing it to OneNote. Browsers often have a "Save as PDF" option when printing a webpage. Once converted, you can insert it into OneNote as an attachment or a visual printout.

If you're trying to achieve something specific with your HTML page in OneNote, feel free to share more details, and Iâ€™ll do my best to help!
